"""Retrieval agent node: the ONLY caller of the search engine.

Extraction: for every field of the task, an EvidenceRequest built from the
field description and search hints (plus the field's doc_types and optional
per-field `top_k`), searched with the bid filter. A second, addendum-only request per field feeds the
Addendum Reconciler. A widened retry uses more query variants, a larger
top_k and no doc-type filter.
Q&A: the plan's queries, searched per bid in scope.

Evidence keys: "<field>" for extraction, "<field>::addendum" for
reconciliation, "qa::<bid>" for questions. An empty result is a bundle with
no hits, never an error.
